# RafAlbums webservice to store Your photos
author: Rafa≈Ç Salawa,
website is still in development - may have some issues to fix, but works overall.

1. Download repository.
2. Create mysql database 'gallery' (default name, you can choose another name, but remember to change it in 'database.php' file).
3. Create database tables accordingly to the sql script in 'database_tables_sql.txt'.
4. Should work now - enjoy! (tested with XAMPP on default settings - modules Apache, MySQL running)
